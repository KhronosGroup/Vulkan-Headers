<!-- Please note when contributing what files this repository actually is responsible for.

Vulkan-Headers exists as a publishing mechanism for headers and related material sourced from multiple other repositories. If you have a problem with that material, it should *not* be reported here, but in the appropriate repository:

- https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs - C headers, XML, validusage.json, and generation scripts
- https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp - C++ headers

The CONTRIBUTING.md contains a list of files this repo owns.
