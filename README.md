## Building

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)

## SDK Support

Vulkan-Headers are shipped as part of the official [Vulkan-SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)

## C/C++ Package Manager Support

`Vulkan-Headers` are also supported by both [conan](https://conan.io/) & [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/).

## Version Tagging Scheme

Updates to the `Vulkan-Headers` repository which correspond to a new Vulkan
specification release are tagged using the following format:
`v<`_`version`_`>` (e.g., `v1.1.96`).

**Note**: Marked version releases have undergone thorough testing but do not
imply the same quality level as SDK tags. SDK tags follow the
`sdk-<`_`version`_`>.<`_`patch`_`>` format (e.g., `sdk-1.1.92.0`).
